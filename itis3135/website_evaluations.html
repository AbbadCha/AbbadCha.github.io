      <h2>Website Evaluations</h2>

      <section>
        <h3><a href="https://www.apple.com">Apple.com</a></h3>
        <p>Apple's website serves as their primary digital storefront and information hub for all Apple products and services.</p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Contrast:</strong> The site masterfully uses contrast with clean white backgrounds against dark text, making content highly readable. Product images pop against minimal backgrounds.</li>
          <li><strong>Repetition:</strong> Consistent typography, button styles, and grid layouts create a cohesive experience across all pages. The familiar navigation and product presentation patterns help users navigate effortlessly.</li>
          <li><strong>Alignment:</strong> Every element is precisely aligned in a grid system. Text blocks, images, and interactive elements follow clear vertical and horizontal alignment principles, creating visual harmony.</li>
          <li><strong>Proximity:</strong> Related elements are grouped logically - product images with their descriptions, pricing with buy buttons, and navigation items are properly spaced for optimal usability.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Assessment: Apple's website exemplifies excellent implementation of CRAP principles. The design is clean, professional, and highly effective at showcasing products while maintaining excellent usability. The consistent design language and attention to detail in spacing, typography, and visual hierarchy make it a benchmark for modern web design.</p>

        <h3><a href="https://www.lingscars.com">LingsCars.com</a></h3>
        <p>Ling's Cars is a car leasing website in the UK known for its intentionally overwhelming and chaotic design.</p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Contrast:</strong> The site uses an excessive mix of bright, clashing colors and various font sizes without any clear hierarchy. Text often blends into backgrounds, making it hard to read.</li>
          <li><strong>Repetition:</strong> While there is repetition, it's chaotic - repeated animated GIFs, flashing elements, and multiple competing patterns create visual noise rather than consistency.</li>
          <li><strong>Alignment:</strong> Elements appear randomly placed with no clear grid system or alignment principles. Text blocks, images, and buttons float in seemingly random positions.</li>
          <li><strong>Proximity:</strong> Related elements are often separated by unrelated content, making it difficult to understand which elements belong together. The cramped layout violates proper spacing principles.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Assessment: While Ling's Cars has become famous for its anti-design approach and has built a successful business around its memorable (if chaotic) brand, it serves as a perfect example of how not to apply CRAP principles. The site deliberately breaks every design rule, creating an overwhelming user experience that, while memorable, makes it challenging to find information or navigate effectively.</p>
