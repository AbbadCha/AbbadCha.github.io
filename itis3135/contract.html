      <h2>Contract</h2>
      
      <p>I, <a href="introduction.html">Abbad Chamma</a> agree to abide by the terms in my Spring 2024 ITIS3135 Web Application Design and Development with my instructor, D.I. von Briesen.</p>
      
      <p>I understand that all work that I do on my school and personal websites will be publicly available to the world. I will not put information there that is inappropriate for schoolwork, or that I wish to keep private.</p>
      
      <p>I also understand that it is my work that counts for attendance, not logins or showing up for class. As such, failure to turn in assignments may show as absences.</p>
